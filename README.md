## Knowledge Gained From This Project

* CSS Grid - This project focused on creating a modern website with the primary focus of using CSS grid. Grid properties used throughout project include gap, align-items, align-content, justify-content, justify-items, justify-self, align-self, use of implicit grid, etc.

* CSS architecture: Usage of the BEM methodology.   

* CSS variables and Sass variables - usage of variables to eliminate repeating code and also making it easier to make adjustments in future with just one change.

* Background Images - usage of linear gradient backgrounds.

* SVG - usage of svg elements which is the more modern way of displaying images in your websites. SVG's cut down on generating multiple HTTP server requests triggered by individual icon fonts and also allows greater flexibility into editing, coloring and animating icons.

* Creation of a sidebar hamburger menu

* Modern responsive design - Using media queries to adjust design and CSS Grid for different screen sizes.
