The sidebar is one column and we gave 8 columns of content in middle for a total of 9 columns. We have 3 more columns to equal standard 12 column layout so we assigned 1.5 columns on both sides of content specified as 1fr in our grid-template-columns in our base.scss page. We end it at col-end 6 to give the remaining 2 columns we have as our content to the realtors section. Remember that each column grid line has 2 names (col-end 1 and col-start 2) for when counting your columns because this could be confusing if you don't remember this.
    grid-column: col-start 7 / full-end; // Starts right after header section I have commented above for reference. Notice how we specify col-start 7 but this is actually the same as col-end 6 above that we gave to header section but remember we can have 2 names for each column grid line so they both referecen the same column grid line but we are just using the different names.
